# Phishing URL detector

> Work in progress. Started October 2026.

Flags phishing links from the URL text alone, without opening the page. Trained on the [PhiUSIIL Phishing URL dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/967/phiusiil+phishing+url+dataset) (UCI, about 235k URLs, 57% legitimate and 43% phishing), served through a small API, and used by a Chrome extension that warns before you land on a risky page.

URL-only matters for two reasons: it's fast enough to run before a page loads, and it never fetches anything from an attacker's server. The cost is less information to work with, and the project measures how much accuracy that costs.

## Plan

- [ ] EDA: URL length, TLDs, subdomains, HTTPS, class balance
- [ ] URL-only feature extractor with tests
- [ ] Baselines (logistic regression, random forest), judged mostly on missed phishing
- [ ] LightGBM and a character-level model on raw URL text
- [ ] Robustness: homoglyphs, URL shorteners, long paths. Where does it break?
- [ ] FastAPI `/score` endpoint + Docker
- [ ] Chrome extension (TypeScript, Manifest V3)
- [ ] CI with security scans

## Stack

Python 3.12, pandas, scikit-learn, LightGBM, FastAPI, TypeScript (extension), pytest, ruff, uv.

## Architecture

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). It includes a threat model focused on how attackers would try to get past the detector.
